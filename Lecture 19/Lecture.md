Doing ANOTHER NFA to DFA example...

### Turing Machines

Has a head that can read or write from/on an infinite tape. The most basic form of a computer. This is a massive upgrade over PDAs- it lets us use multiple stacks at a time, rather than 1 stack.

Turing machines are countable, but languages are uncountable. Paired with the conjecture that every computer problem can be modeled on a turing machine is true, then there are uncountably infinite problems that can never be solved on a computer.
